This section outlines the preprocessing mechanisms considered
and implemented in {\marf}. We present you with the API and structure in \xf{fig:preprocessing}, along with
the description of the methods.

The Endpointing algorithm got implemented in {\marf} as follows.
By the {\em end-points} we mean the local minimums and maximums
in the amplitude changes. A variation of that is whether to
consider the sample edges and continuous data points (of the same
value) as end-points. In {\marf}, all these four cases
are considered as end-points by default with an option to
enable or disable the latter two cases via setters or the \api{ModuleParams}
facility. The endpointing algorithm is implemented in \api{Endpoint}
of the \api{marf.Preprocessing.Endpoint} package and appeared in 0.3.0.5.
