\subsection{Random Feature Extraction}

By default given a window of size 256 samples, it picks
at random a number from a Gaussian distribution, and
multiplies by the incoming sample frequencies.
This all adds up and we have a feature vector at the end.
This should be the bottom line performance of all feature
extraction methods. It can also be used as a relatively fast
testing module.
