\subsection{Euclidean Distance}

The Euclidean Distance classifier uses an Euclidean distance equation to find the
distance between two feature vectors.

If $A=(x_{1},x_{2})$ and $B=(y_{1},y_{2})$ are two 2-dimensional vectors, then the distance between
$A$ and $B$ can be defined as the square root of the sum of the squares of their
differences:

$$ d(x,y) = \sqrt{(x_{1}-y_{1})^{2} + {(x_{2}-y_{2})}^{2}} $$

This equation can be generalized to n-dimensional vectors by simply adding terms
under the square root.

$$ d(x,y) = \sqrt{(x_{n}-y_{n})^{2} + {(x_{n-1}-y_{n-1})}^{2} + ... + {(x_{1}-y_{1})}^{2}} $$

or

$$ d(x,y) = \sqrt{\displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^{n}(x_{k}-y_{k})^{2}} $$

or

$$ d(x,y) = \sqrt{(x-y)^{T}(x-y)} $$


A cluster is chosen based on smallest distance to the feature vector in question.
