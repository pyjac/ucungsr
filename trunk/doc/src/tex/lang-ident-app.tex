\subsubsection{The Program}

The Mini-User Manual is provided in the \xs{sect:lang-ident-app-manual}. The source
is provided in the electronic form only from the release tarballs or the CVS repository.

NOTE: in the code there are a lot of files. Not all of them might
be of a great interest to you since
some of them are stubs right now and don't provide much functionality in them
or the functionality is not linked anyhow to the main application.
These files are:

\begin{verbatim}
./marf/nlp/Collocations:
    ChiSquareTest.java
    CollocationWindow.java
    TTest.java

./marf/Stats/StatisticalEstimators:
    GLI.java
    KatzBackoff.java
    SLI.java

./marf/util/comparators:
    RankComparator.java

./marf/nlp/Stemming:
    StemmingEN.java
    Stemming.java
\end{verbatim}


\subsubsection{Hypotheses}
\index{Language Identification!Hypotheses}

\paragraph{Identifying Non-Latin-Script-Based Languages}

The methodology, if implemented correctly, should work
for natural languages that use non-Latin scripts for
their writing. Of course, to test this, such scripts
will have to be romanized (either transcribed or transliterated
using Latin, more precisely, ASCII characters).

\paragraph{Identifying Programming Languages}
\index{Language Identification!Programming Languages}

I have thought of if the proposed methodology works well for natural
languages, it would probably work at least as good for the programming
languages.

\paragraph{Sophisticated Statistical Estimators Should Work Better}

``Good'' (or ``better'' if you will) statistical estimators presented in \xc{chapt:statitstic-processing}
should give better results (higher language recognition rate) over simpler ones.
By ``simpler'' we mean the MLE and Add-* family. By more sophisticated we mean Witten-Bell,
Good-Turing, and the combination of the Statistical Estimators.

\paragraph{Zipf's Law Can Also Be Effective in Language Identification}
\index{Language Identification!Zipf's Law}
\index{Zipf's Law!Language Identification}

Zipf's Law can be reasonably effective and very ``cheap'' in language identification
task. This one is yet to be verified.

\subsubsection{Initial Experiments Setup}

\paragraph{Languages}

Several natural and programming languages in were used in the experiments.

\paragraph*{Natural Lanugages (NLs)}

\begin{itemize}
\item English (en - ISO 2-letter code code \cite{iso-codes})
\item French (fr, desaccented)
\item Spanish (es, desaccented)
\item Italian (it)
\item Arabic (ar, transcribed in ASCII according to the qalam rules \cite{qalam})
\item Hebrew (he, transcribed in ASCII)
\item Bulgarian (bg, transcribed in ASCII)
\item Russian (ru, transcribed in ASCII)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Programming Languages (PLs)}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\C}/{\cpp} (together, since {\C} is a proper subset of {\cpp})
\item {\java}
\item {\perl}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Statistical Estimators Implemented}

\begin{itemize}
\item MLE in \api{MLE}
\item Add-One in \api{AddOne}
\item Add-Delta (ELE) in \api{AddDelta}
\item Witten-Bell in \api{WittenBell}
\item Good-Turing in \api{GoodTuring}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{N-gram Models}

\begin{itemize}
\item Unigram
\item Bigram
\item Trigram
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Corpora}

\paragraph*{English}

The English language corpora is (not very surprisingly) was the biggest one.
To simplify the training process, we combined them all in one file
\file{en.txt}. It includes
\cite{probst95, ulysses, greif, speak, fannyhill, lysistrata, canterby, defoe, rousseau, tasso}.
Additionally, a few chapters of ``The Little Prince''.
Total size of the combined file is 7Mb.

\paragraph*{French}

For French we used few chapters of ``Le Petit Prince''.
The totals combined size is 12k, \file{fr.txt}.

\paragraph*{Spanish}

Like the French corpora, the Spanish one includes several
chapters of ``Le Petit Prince'' in Spanish (from the same source).
The total size is 12k, \file{es.txt}.

\paragraph*{Arabic}

We have compiled a few surah from transliterated Quran (\cite{quran})
as well as a couple of texts transcribed by Michelle Khalif\'e
from a proverb \cite{jeha} and a passage from a newspaper in Arabic \cite{arnews}.
Total size: 208k, \file{ar.txt}.

\paragraph*{Hebrew}

We used a few poems written by their author (\cite{hepoems}) in ASCII alphabet.
Total size is 37k, \file{he.txt}.

\paragraph*{Russian}

Latinized classics (one whole book) was used (see \cite{ohotnik}).
Total size is 877k, \file{ru.txt}.

\paragraph*{Bulgarian}

A few transcribed poems were used for training from \cite{bgpoems}.
Total size: 21k, \file{bg.txt}.

\paragraph*{Italian}

We used the ``Pinocchio'' book \cite{pinocchio} of the size of 245k, \file{it.txt}.

\paragraph*{C/C++}

Various \file{.c} and \file{.cpp} files were used from a variety of projects
and examples for the ``COMP444 - System Software Design'', ``COMP471 - Computer Graphics'',
``COMP361'', and ``COMP229 - System Software courses''. The total size is 137k, \file{cpp.txt}.

\paragraph*{Java}

As Java ``corpora'' we used the sources of this application at some point in the
development cycle and source files for the MARF project itself.
The total size is 260k, \file{java.txt}.

\paragraph*{Perl}

For {\perl}, we used many of Serguei's scripts written to help with marking of
assignments and accept electronic submissions as well as a couple tools
for CVS written in {\perl} from the Internet (Google keywords: \tool{cvs2cl.pl} and \tool{cvs2html.pl}).
Size: 299k, \file{perl.txt}.

\subsubsection{Methodology}

\paragraph{Add-Delta Family}

Add-Delta is defined as:

$P(\mbox{ngram}) = \frac{C_{\mbox{ngram}} + \delta}{N + \delta \cdot V}$

\noindent
where $V$ is a vocabulary size, $N$ is the number of n-grams that start with {\em ngram}.
By implementing this general Add-Delta smoothing we get MLE, ELE, and Add-One ``for free''
as special cases of Add-Delta:

\begin{itemize}
\item $\delta = 0$ is MLE
\item $\delta = 1$ is Add One
\item $\delta = 0.5$ is ELE
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Witten-Bell and Good Turing}

These two estimators were implemented as given in hopes to get a better
recognition rate over the Add-Delta family.

\subsubsection{Difficulties Encountered}

During the experimentations we faced several problems, some of which
are worth mentioning.

\paragraph{``Bag-of-Languages'' and Alphabets}

From this point now on, by an {\em alphabet} in this document we mean something more than what people understand
by the language alphabet. In our case an alphabet may include
characters other than letters, such as numbers, punctuation, even
a blank sometimes, all being derived from a training corpus.

Initially, we attempted to treat programming languages as if they
were natural ones. That way, from the developer's standpoint we deal with
them all uniformly. This assumption could be viewed as cheating
to some extent however because programming languages have a lot larger
alphabets that are necessary lexical parts of the language in addition
to the statements written using ASCII letters. Therefore, this gives a lot of
discriminatory power as compared to the NLs when these characters are
inputted by an user. Treating PLs as using
only ASCII Latin base should lead to a lot
of confusion with English (and sometimes other NLs) because most of the keywords
are English words in addition to literal text strings and comments present within the code.

Among NLs that were transcribed or transliterated in Latin there are alphabetical differences.
For instance, in Arabic there are three h-like sounds that have no
English equivalent, so sometimes numbers 3, 7, and 5 are used for that purpose (or in more
standard LAiLA notation \cite{qalam} capitals are used instead. To be
more fair to others, we let numerals to be a part of the alphabet as well.
Analogous problem existed when using capitals for different sounds as opposed
to direct lowercase transliteration in Arabic making lowercasing
a not necessarily good idea.

Russian and Bulgarian (transcribed from Cyrillic scripts) use
(') and some other symbols (like ([) or (]) in Bulgarian) to represent
certain letters or sounds; hence, they always have to be a part of the
alphabet.
This has caused some problems again, and I thought of another separation that is
needed: Latin-based, Cyrillic-based, and Semitic-based languages,
and our ``bag-of-languages'' approach might no do so well. (We, however, just split
PLs, Latin-based and non-Latin as the end result.)

Even for Latin-based languages that can be a problem. For example, the
letter $k$ does not exist in Spanish or Italian (it may if referred to
the foreign words, such as ``kilogram'' or proper names but is not used otherwise).
So are $w$ and $x$ and maybe some others. The same
with French~--~the letters $k$ and $w$ are very rare (so they didn't happen to be in ``Le Petit
Prince'' corpus used, for example).

\paragraph{Alphabet Normalization}

We {\em do} get different alphabet sizes
of my corpora for a language. The alphabets are derived from the corpora
themselves, so depending on the size some characters that appear in
one corpora might not appear in another. Thus, when we perform classification
task for a given sentence, the models compared may be with differently-sized
alphabets thereby returning a probability of 0.0 for the n-gram's characters that
have not been present yet in a given trained model. This can
be viewed as a non-uniform smoothing of the models and implies necessity
of the normalization of the alphabets of all the language models after
accounting for n-grams has been made, and only then smooth.

Language model normalization in has not been implemented yet. Such normalization, however, will
provoke a problem of data sparseness similar to the one described below.
This presents a problem for smoothing techniques, because some counts
we get, $N$ of either n-grams or (n-1)-grams, will have values of 0.0 and
division by 0.0 will become a problem.

\paragraph{N-grams with $n > 2$}

The implemented maximum so far is $n = 3$, but it is a general problem for any $n$.
The problem stems from
the excessive data sparseness of the models for $n > 2$. Taking for
example MLE~---~it won't be able to cope with it properly without
special care because $N$ there is now a two-dimensional matrix,
which can easily be 0.0 in places and the division by zero is unavoidable.
Analogous problem exists in the Good-Turing smoothing.
To solve this we have said if $N = 0$ make $N=1$. Maybe by doing
so (as this is a quite a kludge) we have created more trouble,
but that was the ``design decision'' in the first implementation.

\subsubsection{Experiments}

\paragraph{Bag-of-Languages and the Language Split}

We came up with a few testing sentences/statements for all languages
(can be found in the \file{test.langs} file, see \xf{fig:lang-ident-sentences}).
Then, based on my random observations above we conducted more guided experiments.

\begin{figure}\small
\hrule\vskip4pt
\input{test.langs.tex}
\caption{Sample sentences in various languages used for testing. Was used in ``Bag-of-Languages'' experiments.}

\input{test.latin.langs.tex}
\caption{Subset of the sample sentences in languages with Latin base.}
\label{fig:lang-ident-latin}
\vskip4pt\hrule
\end{figure}

The sentences from the \xf{fig:lang-ident-sentences} were used as-is to pipe to
the program for classification for the bag-of-languages approach. This
file has been split into parts (see \xf{fig:lang-ident-latin}, \xf{fig:lang-ident-nonlatin},
and \xf{fig:lang-ident-pls}) to try out other approaches as well (see \xs{sect:lang-ident-training}).

\begin{figure}\small
\hrule\vskip4pt
\input{test.non-latin.langs.tex}
\caption{Subset of the sample sentences in languages with non-Latin base.}
\label{fig:lang-ident-nonlatin}

\end{figure}

\hrule\vskip4pt
\input{test.pls.langs.tex}
\caption{Subset of the sample statements in programming languages.}
\label{fig:lang-ident-pls}
\vskip4pt\hrule
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Tokenization}

We used two types of tokenizer, {\bf restricted} and {\bf unrestricted} to experiment with
the diverse alphabets.
The ``restricted tokenizer'' means lowercase-folded ASCII characters and numbers (more corresponding
to the original requirements). The ``unrestricted tokenizer''
means additional characters are allowed and it is case-sensitive.
In both tokenizers blanks are discarded.
An implementation of these tokenizer settings via command-line options is still a TODO,
so we were simply changing the code and recompiling. The code has an unrestricted tokenizer
(\file{NLPStreamTokenizer.java} under \file{marf/nlp/util}).


\subsubsection{Training}
\label{sect:lang-ident-training}

We trained language models to include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item all the languages (both NLs and PLs) with the restricted tokenizer
\item all the languages with the unrestricted tokenizer
\item latin-based NLs (English, French, Spanish, and Italian) with the restricted tokenizer
\item non-latin-based romanized NLs (Arabic, Hebrew, Russian, and Bulgarian) with the unrestricted tokenizer
\item PLs ({\java}, {\C}/{\cpp}, {\perl}) with the unrestricted tokenizer.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Results}

\paragraph{Brief Summary}

(Brief because there's more elaborate Conclusion section).

So far, the results are good in places, sometimes pitiful.
Trigrams alone generally were very poor and slow for us.
Unigrams and bigrams performed quite well, however.

More detailed results can be observed in the \xa{sect:lang-classification-results}.
Below are the numbers as a recognition rate of the
sentences presented earlier for every language model.
Note that numbers by themselves may not convey
enough information, one has to look at the detailed results further
to actually realize that the number of samples is debatable
to be good and so are the training corpora is not
uniform. One might also want to look which languages
get confused with each other.

\subsubsection{Conclusions}

\paragraph{Concrete Points}

\begin{itemize}

\item
The best results we've got so far from simpler language models;
especially using languages with the Latin base only.

\item
The methodology did work for non-Latin languages as well. Not 100\% of the time,
but around 60\%, but this is a start.

\item
Witten-Bell and Good-Turing performed rather poorly in our tests in general.
We think we need a lot larger corpora to test out Witten-Bell and Good-Turing
smoothing more thoroughly. This can be confirmed by some of the results
where Good-Turing gave us all English and English is the biggest
corpus we've got.

\item
Identification of the Latin-based languages among themselves was the best one.
It worked OK in the bag-of-languages approach.

\item
The strict tokenizer and bag-of-languages were surprisingly good (or at least
better than we expected).

\item
Recognition of the programming languages according to the conducted
experiments can be qualified as ``so-so'' when PLs are compared to
each other only. They were recognized slightly better in the bag-of-languages
approach (due to the larger alphabets).

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Generalities}

Some of the hypotheses didn't hold (``better techniques would do better'' and
``PLs can be identified as easily as NLs''),
some didn't have time allotted to them yet (``try out Zipf's Law for the purpose
of the language identification'').

In the next releases, we want to experiment with more things, for example,
cross-validation and held-out estimation as well as
linear interpolations and Katz Backoff.


\subsubsection{Mini User Manual}
\label{sect:lang-ident-app-manual}

\paragraph{System Requirements}

The application was primarily developed under Linux, so there's
a \file{Makefile} and a testing shell script to simplify some routine tasks.
For JVM, any JDK 1.4.* and above will do. \tool{tcsh} would be nice
to have to be able to run the batch script. Since the application
itself is written in {\java}, it's not bound to specific architecture,
thus may be compiled and run without the makefiles and scripts
on virtually any operating system.

\paragraph{How To Run It}

In order for the below to work you'd need some corpora in
the same directory as the application. (Check the reference
section for the corpora used in the experiments.)
There are thousands of ways how to run the program. Some of them are listed below.

\paragraph{Using the Shell Scripts}

There are two scripts out there -- \tool{training.sh} and \tool{testing.sh}.
The former is used to do batch training on all the languages and all the models,
the latter to perform batch-testing of the models. They hide the complexity
of typing many options to the users. If you are ever to use them, tweak
them appropriately for the specific languages and n-gram models if you don't
all all-or-nothing testing.

The scripts are written using the \tool{tcsh} syntax; hence, \tool{tcsh} should be
present. The scripts ensure
that the program was compiled first, by invoking \tool{make}, then
in several \verb+for()+ loops feed all the options and filenames to the application.

Type:

\noindent
\verb+./training.sh+

to train the models.

\noindent
\verb+./testing.sh+

to test the models. NOTE: to start testing right away, you need the \file{*.gzbin} files
(pre-trained models) which should be copied from a \file{training-*} directory
of your choice to the application's directory.

\paragraph{Running The LangIdentApp Application}
\label{sect:lang-ident-app}

You can run the application itself without any wrapping scripts
and provide options to it. This is a command-line application,
so there is no GUI associated with it yet (next release). To run the application
you have to compile it first. You can use either \tool{make} with no
arguments to compile or use a standard Java compiler.

\noindent
\tool{make}

or

\noindent
\verb+javac -cp marf.jar:. LangIdentApp.java+

After having compiled the application, you can run it with the JVM.
There are several required options:

\begin{itemize}
\item
\verb+-char+ makes sure we deal with characters instead of strings of characters as a part of an n-gram

\item
one of the statistical estimators (see below); if none present, it won't pick any default one

\item
language parameter (it may seem awkward to require it for identification, but this will fixed,
so for now use anything for it, like ``foo''). Thus, the ``language'' is a typically two-to-four letter
abbrieviation of the language you are trying to train on (w.g. ``en'', ``es'', ``java'', etc.).

\item
corpus - a path to the corpus file for training. For testing just use ``bar''.
\end{itemize}

If you want an interactive mode to enter sentences yourself, use the \verb+-interactive+
option. E.g.:

\verb+java -cp marf.jar:. LangIdentApp --ident -char -interactive -bigram -add-delta foo bar+

Here are the options as per the application's output:
