\subsubsection{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
\item Implementation: \api{marf.Classification.Distance.MahalanobisDistance}
\item Depends on: \api{marf.Classification.Distance.Distance}
\item Used by: \api{test}, \api{marf.MARF}, \api{SpeakerIdentApp}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Theory}

This distance classification is meant to be able to detect features
that tend to vary together in the same cluster if linear
transformations are applied to them, so it becomes invariant
from these transformations unlike all the other, previously seen
distance classifiers.

$$ d(x,y) = \sqrt{(x-y) C^{-1} (x-y)^{T}} $$

\noindent
where $x$ and $y$ are feature vectors of the same length $n$, and
$C$ is a covariance matrix, learnt during training for co-related
features.

In this release, namely 0.3.0-devel,
the covariance matrix being an identity matrix, $ C = I $,
making Mahalanobis distance be the same as the Euclidean one.
We need to complete the learning of the covariance matrix
to complete this classifier.
