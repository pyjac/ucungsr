\subsection{Chebyshev Distance}

Chebyshev distance is used along with other distance classifiers
for comparison. Chebyshev distance is also known as
a city-block or Manhattan distance. Here's its mathematical representation:

$$ d(x,y) = \displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^{n}(|x_{k}-y_{k}|) $$

\noindent
where $x$ and $y$ are feature vectors of the same length $n$.
