The \api{TestPlugin} testing application in {\marf}
tests and serves as an example of how to write
\api{SampleLoader}, \api{Preprocessing}, \api{FeatureExtraction}, and
\api{Classification} plugins to be used by the main
\api{MARF}'s pipeline.

The application is made to exercise the {\marf}'s
interfaces \api{ISampleLoader}, \api{IPreprocessing}, \\\api{IFeatureExtraction}, and
\api{IClassification} along with the \api{MARF} itself. These interfaces
are implemented in the variety of ways. The sample loader is nearly identical
to the functionality of \api{WAVLoader} except that it yanks out checks
for sample format making it ``unrestricted'' (for illustratory purposes).
Random preprocessing is used to multiply the incoming amplitudes by
a pseudo-random Gausian distribution. The feature extraction is then
performed by convering the incoming variable-length input into chunks of
fixed size elements of which are added pairwise. Finally, the classification
does summing, logical AND, OR, and XOR ``hashing'' and applying a modulus
of the number of speakers we have. The actual samples are either the real
wave samples or a generated sine wave used.
