\subsection{Minkowski Distance}

Minkowski distance measurement is a generalization of both Euclidean
and Chebyshev distances.

$$ d(x,y) = \left(\displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^{n}(|x_{k}-y_{k}|)^{r}\right)^\frac{1}{r} $$

\noindent
where $r$ is a Minkowski factor. When $r=1$, it becomes Chebyshev distance,
and when $r=2$, it is the Euclidean one. $x$ and $y$ are feature vectors of the same length $n$.
