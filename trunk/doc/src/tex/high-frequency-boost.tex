$Revision: 1.11 $

This filter was also implemented on top of the FFT filter to boost the high-end
frequencies. The frequencies boosted after approx. 1000~Hz by a factor
of $5\pi$, heuristically determined, and then re-normalized. See \xf{fig:high-boost}.
The implementation of the high-frequency boost preprocessor can be found in
\api{marf.Preprocessing.FFTFilter.HighFrequencyBoost}.
