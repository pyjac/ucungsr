$Revision: 1.3 $

The \api{MathTestApp} application targets
testing of the math-related implementations in the
\api{marf.math} package. As of this writing, the
application mainy exercises the \api{Matrix} class
as this is the one used by the \api{MahalanobisDistance}
classifier. It also does the necessary testing
of the \api{Vector} class as well.

The application supports the following set of options:

\begin{itemize}
\item
\texttt{--help} or \texttt{-h} cause the application to
display the usage information and exit.

\item
\texttt{--version} displays the application's and the
unrelying {\marf}'s versions and exits.
\end{itemize}

\noindent

Before running tests, the application validates the
MARF version, and then produces the output to STDOUT of
various linear matrix operations, such as inversion,
identity, multiplication, transposal, scaling, rotation,
translation, and shear. The stored
output in the \file{expected} folder, \file{math.out},
contains expected output the authors believe is correct
and which is used in the regression testing.
