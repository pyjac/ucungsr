\subsection{Random Classification}

That might sound strange, but we have a random classifier in {\marf}.
This is more or less testing module just to quickly test
the PR pipeline.  It picks an ID in the pseudo-random manner from the list of
trained IDs of subjects to classification.  It also serves as
a bottom-line of performance (i.e. recognition rate) for all
the other, slightly more sophisticated classification methods meaning
performance of the aforementioned methods must be better than
that of the Random; otherwise, there is a problem.
