\scriptsize
you should submit a paper listing and report and an electronic version of your code

\par
implement the CYK algorithm to find the best parse for a given sentence

\par
your program should take as input a probabilistic grammar and a sentence and display the best parse tree along with its probability

\par
you are not required to use a specific programming language

\par
Perl, CPP, C or Java are appropriate for this task

\par
as long as you explain it, your grammar can be in any format you wish

\par
your grammar can be in any format you wish as long as you explain it

\par
experiment with your grammar

\par
is it restrictive enough

\par
does it refuse ungrammatical sentences

\par
does it cover all grammatical sentences

\par
write a report to describe your code and your experimentation

\par
your report must describe the program

\par
your report must describe the experiments

\par
describe your code itself

\par
indicate the instructions necessary to run your code

\par
describe your choice of test sentences

\par
describe your grammar and how you developed it

\par
what problems do you see with your current implementation

\par
what problems do you see with your current grammar

\par
how would you improve it

\par
both the code and the report must be submitted electronically and in paper

\par
in class, you must submit a listing of your program and results and the report

\par
through the electronic submission form you must submit the code of your program and results and an electronic version of your report
