As the low-pass filter, the high-pass filter (e.g. is in \xf{fig:high-pass})
has been realized on top of the FFT Filter,
in fact, it is the opposite to low-pass filter, and filters out
frequencies before 2853~Hz.
The implementation of the high-pass filter can be found in
\api{marf.Preprocessing.FFTFilter.HighPassFilter}.
