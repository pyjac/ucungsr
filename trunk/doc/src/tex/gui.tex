[UPDATE ME]

Even though this section is entitled as GUI, we don't
really have too much GUI yet (it's planned though,
see TODO, \ref{appx:todo}). We do have a couple
of things under the \api{marf.gui} package, which we do
occasionally use and eventually they will expand to be a real
GUI classes. This tiny package is in Figure \ref{fig:gui}.
