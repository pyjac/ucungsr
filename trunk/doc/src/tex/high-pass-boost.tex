$Revision: 1.2 $

For experimentation we said what would be very useful to do is
to test a high-pass filter along with high-frequency boost.
While there is no immediate class that does this, \api{MARF}
now chains the former and the latter via the new addition
to the preprocessing framework (in 0.3.0-devel-20050606)
where a constructor of one preprocessing module takes up another allowing
a preprocessing pipeline on its own. The results of this
experiment can be found in the Consolidated Results section.
While they did not yield a better recognition performance,
it was a good try to see. More tweaking and trying is
required to make a final decision on this approach as there
is an issue with the re-normalization of the entire input
instead of just the boosted part.
