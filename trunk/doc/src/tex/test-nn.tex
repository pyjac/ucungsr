\api{TestNN} is one a testing applications in {\marf}
that aims to test how the neural network algorithm described in \xs{sect:nnet} works in
\api{Classification}.

From user's point of view, \api{TestNN} provides with usage and loaders
command-line options. By entering \texttt{--help} or \texttt{-h}
the usage information will be displayed.

The application is made to exercise the {\marf}'s implementation of the
artificial neural network algorithm located in the \api{marf.Classification.NeuralNetwork} package.
Additionally, the following {\marf} modules are utilized:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
\api{marf.util.OptionProcessor}

\item
\api{marf.util.Arrays}

\item
\api{marf.util.Debug}
\end{enumerate}
