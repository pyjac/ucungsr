[WORK ON THIS SECTION IS IN PROGRESS AS WE PROCEED WITH F0 IMPLEMENTATION IN {\marf}]

F0, the fundamental frequency, or ``pitch''.

Ian: ``The text (\cite{shaughnessy2000}) doesn't go into too much detail but gives a few techniques. Most
seem to involve another preprocessing to remove high frequencies and then
some estimation and postprocessing correction. Another, more detailed
source may be needed.''

Serguei: ``One of the prerequisites we already have: the low-pass filter that
does remove the high frequencies.''
