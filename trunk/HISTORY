This project has started as a course project for Pattern Recognition,
Fall 2002, at Concordia University (http://www.concordia.ca/),
Dept. of Computer Science (http://www.cs.concordia.ca), Montreal, Canada,
by four students:

  Ian Clément
  Serguei Mokhov
  Dimitrios Nicolacopoulos
  Stephen Sinclair

The project seems to have survived past that school term,
and is being maintained by us.

[XXX UPDATE:]

There has been three official "releases" of our framework and
and SpeakerIdentApp so far.
